Project Description: MavenTech Sales Performance Dashboard

The MavenTech Quarterly Team Performance Dashboard project aimed to enhance the data visualization capabilities of MavenTech, a leading provider of computer hardware solutions to large businesses. As a BI Developer, my primary goal was to create a dynamic dashboard that would allow MavenTech to gain deeper insights into their sales performance and track team productivity effectively.

Business Needs:

MavenTech identified the need to visualize its sales data outside of its current Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. The existing system provided limited insights and lacked the flexibility to analyze data comprehensively. MavenTech sought to address this gap by developing a customized dashboard tailored to their specific requirements.

Discovery and Presentation of Insights:

To discover meaningful insights, I studied the data thoroughly to gain a better understanding of the KPIs and metrics needed. By leveraging Power BI, I transformed raw sales data into actionable insights.

The dashboard allows managers to track their teams' performance in 2017, enabling them to identify trends, assess sales pipelines, and make informed decisions. Key metrics such as average revenue, win percentage, margin, and average close days are visualized intuitively, providing managers with a comprehensive overview of sales performance.

By presenting data in a visually appealing and user-friendly format, MavenTech can make data-driven decisions that drive business growth and enhance customer satisfaction. I particularly appreciate the functionality provided by field parameters, enabling the toggling of measures within a visual using a slicer. Additionally, I find the HTML visual to be particularly noteworthy, as it offers the flexibility of incorporating dynamic text boxes.

In conclusion, the MavenTech Sales Performance Dashboard project successfully addressed the company's need for improved data visualization and insights. By leveraging advanced analytics techniques and intuitive visualization tools, MavenTech is well-positioned to optimize sales processes, improve team performance, and achieve its business objectives.
